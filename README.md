# Campus Emergency App

The Campus Emergency App is in its initial, yet-to-be-completed phase. Its primary objective is to furnish students and other target users with prompt access to essential emergency locations and information. Developed with modern technology, the concept and specifications for this app were provided by my lecturer, **Mr. Seifu Deso**, as an integral project for the **Mobile Application Development** course, which is part of our department's curriculum.

I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to **Mr. Seifu Deso** for his guidance and encouragement throughout this project. His support and motivation have been instrumental in pushing me to achieve this milestone. His dedication to teaching and guiding students is truly inspiring, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow under his mentorship.

## Installation

To install the Campus Emergency App, follow these steps:

1. **Install Expo CLI:** 
   Expo CLI is a command line app that is the main interface between a developer and Expo tools. You'll use it for a variety of tasks, such as creating new projects, starting the development server, and publishing your projects. For detailed instructions, visit the [Expo Installation Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

2. **Set up Firebase:**
   Firebase provides the backend services you'll need for this app. To get started with Firebase, you'll need to set up a Firebase project and configure your app to use Firebase. For instructions on setting up Firebase, visit the [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs).

Once you have installed Expo CLI and set up Firebase, you can proceed to clone the repository and run the app:
